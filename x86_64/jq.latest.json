  "body": "After a five year hiatus we're back with a GitHub organization, with new admins and new maintainers who have brought a great deal of energy to make a long-awaited and long-needed new release.  We're very grateful for all the new owners, admins, and maintainers.  Special thanks go to Owen Ou (@owenthereal) for pushing to set up a new GitHub organization for jq, Stephen Dolan (@stedolan) for transferring the jq repository to the new organization, @itchyny for doing a great deal of work to get the release done, Mattias Wadman (@wader) and Emanuele Torre (@emanuele6) for many PRs and code reviews.  Many others also contributed PRs, issues, and code reviews as well, and you can find their contributions in the Git log and on the [closed issues and PRs page](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc).\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\nSince the last stable release many things have happened:\r\n\r\n- jq now lives at <https://github.com/jqlang>\r\n- New maintainers, admins, and owners have been recruited.\r\n  - A list of [current maintainers](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/blob/jq-1.7/AUTHORS#L4-L14)\r\n- NEWS file is replaced by NEWS.md with Markdown format. @wader #2599\r\n- CI, scan builds, release, website builds etc now use GitHub actions. @owenthereal @wader @itchyny #2596 #2603 #2620 #2723\r\n- Lots of documentation improvements and fixes.\r\n- Website updated with new section search box, better section ids for linking, dark mode, etc. @itchyny #2628\r\n- Release builds for:\r\n  - Linux `amd64`, `arm64`, `armel`, `armhf`, `i386`, `mips`, `mips64`, `mips64el`, `mips64r6`, `mips64r6el`, `mipsel`, `mipsr6`, `mipsr6el`, `powerpc`, `ppc64el`, `riscv64` and `s390x`\r\n  - macOS `amd64` and `arm64`\r\n  - Windows `i386` and `amd64`\r\n  - Docker `linux/386`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/mips64le`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/riscv64` and `linux/s390x`\r\n  - More details see @owenthereal #2665\r\n- Docker images are now available from `ghcr.io/jqlang/jq` instead of Docker Hub. @itchyny #2652 #2686\r\n- OSS-fuzz. @DavidKorczynski #2760 #2762\r\n\r\nFull commit log can be found at <https://github.com/jqlang/jq/compare/jq-1.6...jq-1.7> but here are some highlights:\r\n\r\n## CLI changes\r\n\r\n- Make object key color configurable using `JQ_COLORS` environment variable. @itchyny @haguenau @ericpruitt #2703\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # this would make \"field\" bold yellow (`1;33`, the last value)\r\n  $ JQ_COLORS=\"0;90:0;37:0;37:0;37:0;32:1;37:1;37:1;33\" ./jq -n '{field: 123}'\r\n  {\r\n    \"field\": 123\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Change the default color of null to Bright Black. @itchyny #2824\r\n- Respect `NO_COLOR` environment variable to disable color output. See <https://no-color.org> for details. @itchyny #2728\r\n- Improved `--help` output. Now mentions all options and nicer order. @itchyny @wader #2747 #2766 #2799\r\n- Fix multiple issues of exit code using `--exit-code`/`-e` option. @ryo1kato #1697\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # true-ish last output value exits with zero\r\n  $ jq -ne true ; echo $?\r\n  true\r\n  0\r\n  # false-ish last output value (false and null) exits with 1\r\n  $ jq -ne false ; echo $?\r\n  false\r\n  1\r\n  # no output value exists with 4\r\n  $ jq -ne empty ; echo $?\r\n  4\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Add `--binary`/`-b` on Windows for binary output. To get `\\n` instead of `\\r\\n` line endings. @nicowilliams 0dab2b1\r\n- Add `--raw-output0` for NUL (zero byte) separated output. @asottile @pabs3 @itchyny #1990 #2235 #2684\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # will output a zero byte after each output\r\n  $ jq -n --raw-output0 '1,2,3' | xxd\r\n  00000000: 3100 3200 3300                           1.2.3.\r\n  # can be used with xargs -0\r\n  $ jq -n --raw-output0 '\"a\",\"b\",\"c\"' | xargs -0 -n1\r\n  a\r\n  b\r\n  c\r\n  $ jq -n --raw-output0 '\"a b c\", \"d\\ne\\nf\"' | xargs -0 printf '[%s]\\n'\r\n  [a b c]\r\n  [d\r\n  e\r\n  f]\r\n  # can be used with read -d ''\r\n  $ while IFS= read -r -d '' json; do\r\n  >   jq '.name' <<< \"$json\"\r\n  > done < <(jq -n --raw-output0 '{name:\"a b c\"},{name:\"d\\ne\\nf\"}')\r\n  \"a b c\"\r\n  \"d\\ne\\nf\"\r\n  # also it's an error to output a string containing a NUL when using NUL separator\r\n  $ jq -n --raw-output0 '\"\\^@\"'\r\n  jq: error (at <unknown>): Cannot dump a string containing NUL with --raw-output0 option\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix assert crash and validate JSON for `--jsonarg`. @wader #2658\r\n- Remove deprecated `--argfile` option. @itchyny #2768\r\n- Enable stack protection. @nicowilliams #2801\r\n\r\n## Language changes\r\n\r\n- Use decimal number literals to preserve precision. Comparison operations respects precision but arithmetic operations might truncate. @leonid-s-usov #1752\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # precision is preserved\r\n  $ echo '100000000000000000' | jq .\r\n  100000000000000000\r\n  # comparison respects precision (this is false in JavaScript)\r\n  $ jq -n '100000000000000000 < 100000000000000001'\r\n  true\r\n  # sort/0 works\r\n  $ jq -n -c '[100000000000000001, 100000000000000003, 100000000000000004, 100000000000000002] | sort'\r\n  [100000000000000001,100000000000000002,100000000000000003,100000000000000004]\r\n  # arithmetic operations might truncate (same as JavaScript)\r\n  $ jq -n '100000000000000000 + 10'\r\n  100000000000000020\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Adds new builtin `pick(stream)` to emit a projection of the input object or array. @pkoppstein #2656 #2779\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  $ jq -n '{\"a\": 1, \"b\": {\"c\": 2, \"d\": 3}, \"e\": 4} | pick(.a, .b.c, .x)'\r\n  {\r\n    \"a\": 1,\r\n    \"b\": {\r\n      \"c\": 2\r\n    },\r\n    \"x\": null\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Adds new builtin `debug(msgs)` that works like `debug` but applies a filter on the input before writing to stderr. @pkoppstein #2710\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  $ jq -n '1 as $x | 2 | debug(\"Entering function foo with $x == \\($x)\", .) | (.+1)'\r\n  [\"DEBUG:\",\"Entering function foo with $x == 1\"]\r\n  [\"DEBUG:\",2]\r\n  3\r\n  $ jq -n '{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3} | debug({a, b, sum: (.a+.b)})'\r\n  [\"DEBUG:\",{\"a\":1,\"b\":2,\"sum\":3}]\r\n  {\r\n    \"a\": 1,\r\n    \"b\": 2,\r\n    \"c\": 3\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Adds new builtin `scan($re; $flags)`. Was documented but not implemented. @itchyny #1961\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # look for pattern \"ab\" in \"abAB\" ignoring casing\r\n  $ jq -n '\"abAB\" | scan(\"ab\"; \"i\")'\r\n  \"ab\"\r\n  \"AB\"\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Adds new builtin `abs` to get absolute value. This potentially allows the literal value of numbers to be preserved as `length` and `fabs` convert to float. @pkoppstein #2767\r\n- Allow `if` without `else`-branch. When skipped the `else`-branch will be `.` (identity). @chancez @wader #1825 #2481\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # convert 1 to \"one\" otherwise keep as is\r\n  $ jq -n '1,2 | if . == 1 then \"one\" end'\r\n  \"one\"\r\n  2\r\n  # behaves the same as\r\n  $ jq -n '1,2 | if . == 1 then \"one\" else . end'\r\n  \"one\"\r\n  2\r\n  # also works with elif\r\n  $ jq -n '1,2,3 | if . == 1 then \"one\" elif . == 2 then \"two\" end\r\n  \"one\"\r\n  \"two\"\r\n  3\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Allow use of `$binding` as key in object literals. @nicowilliams 8ea4a55\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  $ jq -n '\"a\" as $key | {$key: 123}'\r\n  {\r\n    \"a\": 123\r\n  }\r\n  # previously parentheses were needed\r\n  $ jq -n '\"a\" as $key | {($key): 123}'\r\n  {\r\n    \"a\": 123\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Allow dot between chained indexes when using `.[\"index\"]` @nicowilliams #1168\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  $ jq -n '{\"a\": {\"b\": 123}} | .a[\"b\"]'\r\n  123\r\n  # now this also works\r\n  $ jq -n '{\"a\": {\"b\": 123}} | .a.[\"b\"]'\r\n  123\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Allow dot for chained value iterator `.[]`, `.[]?` @wader #2650\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  $ jq -n '{\"a\": [123]} | .a[]'\r\n  123\r\n  # now this also works\r\n  $ jq -n '{\"a\": [123]} | .a.[]'\r\n  123\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Fix try/catch catches more than it should. @nicowilliams #2750\r\n- Speed up and refactor some builtins, also remove `scalars_or_empty/0`. @muhmuhten #1845\r\n- Now `halt` and `halt_error` exit immediately instead of continuing to the next input. @emanuele6 #2667\r\n- Fix issue converting string to number after previous convert error. @thalman #2400\r\n- Fix issue representing large numbers on some platforms causing invalid JSON output. @itchyny #2661\r\n- Fix deletion using assigning empty against arrays. @itchyny #2133\r\n\r\n  ```sh\r\n  # now this works as expected, filter out all values over 2 by assigning empty\r\n  $ jq -c '(.[] | select(. >= 2)) |= empty' <<< '[1,5,3,0,7]'\r\n  [1,0]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Allow keywords to be used as binding name in more places. @emanuele6 #2681\r\n- Allow using `nan` as NaN in JSON. @emanuele6 #2712\r\n- Expose a module's function names in `modulemeta`. @mrwilson #2837\r\n- Fix `contains/1` to handle strings with NUL. @nicowilliams 61cd6db\r\n- Fix `stderr/0` to output raw text without any decoration. @itchyny #2751\r\n- Fix `nth/2` to emit empty on index out of range. @itchyny #2674\r\n- Fix `implode` to not assert and instead replace invalid unicode codepoints. @wader #2646\r\n- Fix `indices/1` and `rindex/1` in case of overlapping matches in strings. @emanuele6 #2718\r\n- Fix `sub/3` to resolve issues involving global search-and-replace (gsub) operations. @pkoppstein #2641\r\n- Fix `significand/0`, `gamma/0` and `drem/2` to be available on macOS. @itchyny #2756 #2775\r\n- Fix empty regular expression matches. @itchyny #2677\r\n- Fix overflow exception of the modulo operator. @itchyny #2629\r\n- Fix string multiplication by 0 (and less than 1) to emit empty string. @itchyny #2142\r\n- Fix segfault when using libjq and threads. @thalman #2546\r\n- Fix constant folding of division and reminder with zero divisor. @itchyny #2797\r\n- Fix `error/0`, `error/1` to throw null error. @emanuele6 #2823\r\n- Simpler and faster `transpose`. @pkoppstein #2758\r\n- Simple and efficient implementation of `walk/1`. @pkoppstein #2795\r\n- Remove deprecated filters `leaf_paths`, `recurse_down`. @itchyny #2666\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/jqlang/jq/compare/jq-1.7rc2...jq-1.7",
